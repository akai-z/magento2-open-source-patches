This patch provides a replacement for the deprecated Google Image Charts service that Magento uses for all 2.x instances and replaces it with the Image-Charts free service.  
Users of Magento 2.x deployments will not be able to view static charts in Magento 2.x instances unless they download and apply this patch.  
See [Switch from deprecated Google Image Charts to Image-Charts for Magento](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024850172) for more information.
