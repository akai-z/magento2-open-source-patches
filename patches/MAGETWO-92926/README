Resolution of issues that customers were experiencing when upgrading to Magento 2.2.4 in deployments that span multiple websites.
Magento multi-store installations were not using the store view-specific values from the store configuration settings if these settings differed from the global default configuration settings.
Instead, Magento used the default configuration for all store views.
