This hotfix resolves an issue with Magento Commerce and Open Source 2.4.1 and 2.3.6 where the "Create an Account" button on the Create New Account page remains disabled if a shopper has entered invalid data.  
This prevents shoppers from re-attempting to create an account after making an error.  
Affected Magento versions: Magento Commerce and Open Source v2.4.1 / v2.3.6 (on prem and Cloud).

See [Applying patches](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/comp-mgr/patching.html) for specific instructions on downloading and applying Magento patches.
